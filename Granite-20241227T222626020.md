==Foundation models==
A foundation model is an AI model trained on broad data at scale such that it can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://hai.stanford.edu/news/introducing-center-research-foundation-models-crfm|title=Introducing the Center for Research on Foundation Models (CRFM)|website=Stanford HAI|date=18 August 2021 }}</ref>

Granite's first foundation models were Granite.13b.instruct and Granite.13b.chat. The "13b" in their name comes from 13 billion, the amount of parameters they have as models, lesser than most of the larger models of the time.  Later models vary from 3 to 34 billion parameters.<ref name="auto1"/><ref>{{Cite web |last=Pawar |first=Sahil |date=2023-09-11 |title=IBM Introduces Granite Series LLM Models for Watsonx Platform |url=https://analyticsdrift.com/ibm-introduces-granite-series-llm-models-for-watsonx-platform/ |access-date=2024-05-09 |website=Analytics Drift |language=en-US}}</ref>

On May 6, 2024, IBM released the [[source code]] of four variations of Granite Code Models under [[Apache License|Apache 2]], an open source [[Permissive software license|permissive license]] that allows completely free use, modification and sharing of the software, and put them on [[Hugging Face]] for public use.<ref>{{Cite news |last=Nine |first=Adrianna |date=May 7, 2024 |title=IBM Makes Granite AI Models Open-Source Under New InstructLab Platform |url=https://www.extremetech.com/computing/ibm-makes-granite-ai-models-open-source-under-new-instructlab-platform |work=[[ExtremeTech]]}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |title=IBM open-sources its Granite AI models - and they mean business |url=https://www.zdnet.com/article/ibm-open-sources-its-granite-ai-models-and-they-mean-business/ |access-date=2024-05-21 |website=ZDNET |language=en}}</ref> According to IBM's own report, Granite 8b outperforms [[Llama 3]] on several [[Computer programming|coding]] related tasks within similar range of parameters.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Jindal |first=Siddharth |date=2024-05-07 |title=IBM Releases Open-Source Granite Code Models, Outperforms Llama 3 |url=https://analyticsindiamag.com/ibm-releases-open-source-granite-code-models-outperforms-llama-3/ |access-date=2024-05-09 |website=Analytics India Magazine |language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |last=Synced |date=2024-05-13 |title=IBM's Granite Code: Powering Enterprise Software Development with AI Precision {{!}} Synced |url=https://syncedreview.com/2024/05/13/ibms-granite-code-powering-enterprise-software-development-with-ai-precision/ |access-date=2024-05-21 |website=syncedreview.com |language=en-US}}</ref>
